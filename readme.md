Nostra an under development e-commerce Full-Stack web application Built with React/Nextjs for the client and server side logic, Mongodb for the database and styled with Scss, This project is meant to put everything i have learnt so far to a good use and challenge my problem solving, creativity and looking up information skills to their limits. I picked up a random design on dribble and decided to animate it. [Design link](https://dribbble.com/shots/20743352-Fashion-E-commerce-Landing-Page).

## ‚úçüèª What I Learned

### Development wise

- Styling tricks such as creating custom animated elements with css before and after pseudo classes, also learnt how to manipulate their properties with javaScript, since pseudo classes are not part of the DOM we have to assign their properties dynamic css `--var()` values which are available to be manipulated by JavaScript.

- Styling React swiper carousels to perfectly match the design, additionally how to use the more complex event listeners to create custom swiper which listens and respond to drag and touch events.

- Creating more complex forms with strict client side validation using Formik and Yup libraries, also learned what are regexs and how to use them to validate user input.

- How to switch between server and client rendering in Nextjs depending on the component's purpose.

- How to use Nextjs api endpoints.

- Error handling and sending accurate error responses dependent on the met edge case.

- How to implement next auth providers and credentials authentication.

- How to create jwts and how to use them to create and validate verification links on the server.

- Using Oauth 2, nodemailer, free email templates services to send customized verification emails.

### Production wise

- In development cycle Next.js applications does not complain about case senstivity when it comes to environment variables. example: if you have an env var like this one `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID  = foobar` and it was used like this `clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_Google_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` notice how **GOOGLE** casing is obviously different in both snippets, this works completely fine in dev mode but it can make you question your life in production.

- Always use async await when calling functions that communicates with an external api, even if it is not needed and works fine on your local host, it is another story in production. example: this function located in the utils directory `const mail = sendEmail(args)` will once called in the server dev mode it worked alright bit in prod `await` must be used.
